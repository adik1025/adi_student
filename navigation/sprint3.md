## Creating a messages API

Our project is called Instabox!!! It's a chat platform where the server sends you a random message every day, and you're ranked on a leaderboard with other users based on how fast you reply. We set up a frontend so users can send messages and tweak their profiles, and built a backend to store everything.

A key accomplishment was to create a messages API to get and post messages. Also, I used a trivia API to post a fun and engaging question into the chat box. I guided my teammates working on frontend by showing them how to use the APIs.
