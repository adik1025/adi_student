To avoid this, allow users to set personalized goals, offer varying difficulty levels, and include adaptive workout plans that consider different health conditions. Ensuring diverse representations in your training data and user testing can also help make recommendations fair and inclusive."

This bias could stem from an algorithm trained predominantly on popular movies and shows, overlooking niche interests or specific needs. A possible fix is to expand data collection to emphasize lesser-seen content and conduct targeted user testing with diverse audiences, ensuring more balanced recommendations for all."
