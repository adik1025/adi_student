    "**Concept Overview:**  \n",
    "Social Network Analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It involves representing individuals or entities as nodes and their relationships or interactions as edges in a graph. This approach helps in understanding the dynamics, influence, and structure of social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation of Users and Relationships in Social Networks:**  \n",
    "- **Nodes:** In social networks, nodes represent users, accounts, or entities. Each node can have attributes such as name, age, location, or interests.  \n",
    "- **Edges:** Edges represent relationships or interactions between nodes. These can be directed (e.g., follower-following relationships on Twitter) or undirected (e.g., mutual friendships on Facebook). Edges can also have weights to indicate the strength or frequency of interactions, such as the number of messages exchanged or likes given.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of a Real-World Social Media Platform:**  \n",
    "- **Platform:** Facebook  \n",
    "- **Role of Graph Theory:** Facebook uses graph theory extensively in its \"Social Graph,\" where users are nodes, and friendships or interactions are edges. Graph algorithms are applied to recommend friends, identify communities, and analyze the spread of information or influence within the network. For instance, the \"People You May Know\" feature leverages graph-based techniques to suggest potential connections by analyzing mutual friends and shared interests."
