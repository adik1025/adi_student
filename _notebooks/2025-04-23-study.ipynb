    "To study for the AP Exam, I will mainly be reviewing topics in Big Ideas 2, 3, and 5 in a book that I bought online. This will help me gain more understanding of the topics in AP CSP in a more focused and organized manner. The book recommends that I take a mock exam in a week, so I will be doing that to asses my improvement over time. Also, competing the 2021 MCQ helped me gain more experience in AP CSP-style problems. However, (correct me if I'm wrong) I believe that the best way is not to review the Team Teach Lessons because I feel that many of the topis covered in those lessons do not align fully with the College Board curriculum."
