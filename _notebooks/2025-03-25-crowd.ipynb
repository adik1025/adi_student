    "An example of crowdsourcing in Minecraft is the Minecraft Marketplace. The platform allows players and creators to design and share custom content such as skins, maps, and mods. This content is then made available to the global Minecraft community, often for purchase. By enabling creators to contribute their work, Minecraft leverages crowdsourcing to expand its ecosystem and provide diverse, user-generated content for players worldwide."
